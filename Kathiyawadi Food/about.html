                Kathiyawadi cuisine â€“ a spicy and fiery cuisine that hails from an Indian western state Gujarat. Kathyiawad is comprised of Saurashtra region with major cities such as Porbandar, Jamnagar, Bhavnagar, Rajkot and Junagadh.Kathiyawadi thali impresses from the very start itself. The papad and tadela marcha, or fried green chillies, served right at the beginning give a perfect opening to the grand feast. The papad makes a re-entry in a curried form with Papad Ki Sabzi. Sev Tamatar Subzi (chickpea noodles in tomato gravy), Dahi Bhindi, Tindora Nu Shaak (sweet-and-savoury ivy gourd), and dal follows soon after. There are also some seasonal dishes added in Thali for a short them when fresh produce is available like Ringana Methi Nu Shaak (eggplant cooked with fenugreek leaves) or Bharela Ringan(stuffed eggplant). Lasania Bataka(boiled potatoes cooked in ginger garlic and tomato mix), and Kathiawadi Dhokali Nu Shak(Besan dumplings in spicy gravy) are also some of the popular delicacies you would find in the thali. Rotli(Rotis) and Bakhris( a coarser bread made of bajra) with huge dollops of ghee or butter is another common find in a typical Kathiawadi thali. However, it is the spicy Tikhari or Kadhi(unlike its sweet counterpart in the Gujarati thali) and Khichdi or Undhiyo that can be called the stars of the Kathiyawadi Thali. After you meal, you must try Gol and Ghee, a popular dessert preparation of the Kathiawadis that is made with melt-in-mouth jagerry and desi ghee, to conclude the lavish treat.Gujarati snacks like Dhokla, Thepla and Khandwi are filled with rich and moreish flavours and are popular all over the world. However, very few people are aware of the delicious and generous thalis of Gujarat. One such Thali is the Kathiyawadi Thali which traces its origin to the Kathiyawar peninsula of Western Gujarat. Generally called the spicy cousin of Gujarati Thali, Kathiyawadi Thali uses a generous amount of onion and garlic. While Aam Ras is an essential part of the Gujarati Thali, Kathiyawadi Thali has Buttermilk or Lassi as its opener. Are you already salivating? Well, you can make Kathiyawadi Thali at home by including these five dishes in your platter.
